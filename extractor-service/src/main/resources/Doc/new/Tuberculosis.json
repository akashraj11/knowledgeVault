Tuberculosis is an infectious disease that usually affects the lungs. Compared with other diseases caused by a single infectious agent, tuberculosis is the second biggest killer, globally.

In 2015, 1.8 million people died from the disease, with 10.4 million falling ill.

In the 18th and 19th centuries, a tuberculosis epidemic rampaged throughout Europe and North America, before the German microbiologist Robert Koch discovered the microbial causes of tuberculosis in 1882. 

During a latent stage, TB has no symptoms. When TB is active TB, the cough, fever, and other symptoms can appear.

While TB usually affects the lungs, it can also affect other parts of the body, and the symptoms will vary accordingly.

Without treatment, TB can spread to other parts of the body through the bloodstream:

    The bones: There may be spinal pain and joint destruction.
    The brain: It can lead to meningitis.
    The liver and kidneys: It can impair the waste filtration functions and lead to blood in the urine.
    The heart: It can impair the heart's ability to pump blood, resulting in cardiac tamponade, a condition that can be fatal.
 
TB medication can be toxic to the liver, and although side effects are uncommon, when they do occur, they can be quite serious. Potential side effects should be reported to a doctor and include:

    Dark urine
    Fever
    Jaundice
    Loss of appetite
    Nausea and vomiting
